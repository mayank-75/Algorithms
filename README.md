### ALGORITHMS  AND DATA STRUCTURES QUESTIONS FOR CODING ENTHUSIASTS

- Compilation of various coding questions and standard Algorithms.

- All questions are coded in c++ programming language.

- Questions topic, coding platform and questions itself can be recognised by the file name of the code.

- These are questions which I have solved and encountered during my placement preparation for IT companies and found them         important and useful for revising different data structures concepts.

- Will be adding more questions as I solve them.

*These questions can be used as reference if you are preparing for coding rounds for IT companies.*

Happy Coding ! :)
